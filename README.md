**Project Description:**

The project involves the creation of an input/output (I/O) library using Assembly language. The primary goal is to develop efficient and low-level I/O operations that can handle various tasks like reading from and writing to different data streams. This library will be designed to provide high performance and flexibility, leveraging the power of Assembly for direct hardware communication.

To ensure the correctness and functionality of the I/O library, it will be thoroughly tested using Python. Python will act as a higher-level testing framework, allowing us to automate and validate the I/O operations provided by the Assembly library through well-structured test cases.

This project will include:
- Designing and implementing the I/O library in Assembly language.
- Handling input/output operations like reading from files, standard input, and output streams.
- Optimizing the library for performance and reliability.
- Writing comprehensive test cases in Python to ensure that the library behaves as expected under various conditions.

By integrating Python as a testing tool, we will combine the low-level efficiency of Assembly with the simplicity and flexibility of Python, creating a robust and well-tested library for future applications.
